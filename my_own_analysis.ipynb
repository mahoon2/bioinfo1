    "The original article suggested strong evidences such that:\n",
    "- Integral membrane protein coding mRNAs are highly enriched by LIN28A (and also, their translation highly downregulated)\n",
    "- Specifically, co-transcriptionally ER translocated mRNAs are highly enriched by LIN28A\n",
    "- LIN28A is localized to peri-ER area\n",

    "But since motif score analysis done by HMM didn't show differences between ER-associated mRNAs and non-ER-associated mRNAs, we still don't know why LIN28A is localized to peri-ER area. So I will start from following hypotheses:\n",
    "1. LIN28A interacts with ER surface protein/lipid\n",
    "2. LIN28A interacts with RBP or adapter protein s.t. co-transcriptionally bounds to ER-associated mRNA.\n",
    "3. LIN28A directly recognizes ER-associated mRNA sequence/structure/modification context."
